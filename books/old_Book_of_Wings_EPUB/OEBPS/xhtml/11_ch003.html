<p class="ch-aut"><em>Et le printemps m&#8217;a apport&#233; l&#8217;affreux rire de l&#8217;idiot</em>.<br/>And spring brought with it the dreadful laugh of the idiot.</p>
<p class="ch-aut">&#8211;Arthur Rimbaud<br/><small>UNE SAISON EN ENFER, A SEASON IN HELL</small></p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-06">The Flood</p>
<p class="noindent">Alone in the Latin Quarter, a wallflower pressed up against grey cut stone, an elite backpack about the feet, flamboyant people dashed around me like human caffeine in the street. Standing downwind from l&#8217;Hotel de M&#233;dicis, I was catatonic. Face in a slow distortion sadness, nausea rising up throat, a hot bubble just behind the eyes. I left Shams, or did he leave me?</p>
<p class="noindent">The sun blinded. Stabbed me right through the clouds on that April spring morning. I tried to shoulder my baggage as all grace. Refuge anyone? Nothing remained solid. The body a bag of lava, weak, unable to carry the load, helpless and incapable of asking for help&#8212;what rot.</p>
<p class="noindent">I waited wallside until all the pigeons had left the area. Peeled myself from the stones and dragged my body around devouring streets de l&#8217;&#201;p&#233;e, l&#8217;Assas, Passage d&#8217;Enfer, rue Monge. Paris catacombs to the left and cat-walkers to the right. Up ahead, at the tip of Jardin des Grands Explorateurs, I found a hidden bench under cherry blossoms for my dumbfoundedness. Legs shut down. Head bowed but without intent, only shame. I sat for hours without moving, without meditation. Guts gathered mid-chest, a yellow fist, heavy as a punched sun.</p>
<p class="noindent">By early evening, I had raised myself up and found a way into a medieval palace among palaces built out of rock for the wealthy. The kind of high-end, neglected mansion where you scaled a steep, crackling, wooden staircase and fell apart in a low-ceilinged attic room, barely giving thanks for the money in your pocket.</p>
<p class="noindent">The walls, carpet and sheets rose pink, the view in ruins. Les Ar&#232;nes de Lut&#232;ce, first-century remains of a Roman amphitheatre, no less. Even there, guards committed slaves, women and poor folks to the higher tiers. Little did they know we get the best views from up here. The writer can only ask for a desk facing open sky and a torrent of shame at the ready. African ancestors at the listening. Notebook open and pencil like a starting pistol. Wine. Music of Mind. Hell all else.</p>
<p class="noindent">My prayer thrusts aside those who have no hope beyond small deaths, and so I let myself be seized by fruition and fruitlessness. I let myself cry out with open mouth and closed eyes as I expel myself from paradise.</p>
<p class="noindent">Labour was tough, separation slow. It&#8217;s the damn placenta I couldn&#8217;t shake! It leadened me like an extra organ that should have been temporary. Pulled at my eyelids at inopportune moments. No amount of water or wine could ever wash away all this blood.</p>
<p class="noindent">All the oceans drain away now. Tears are torrents from stone. Amniotic fluid for no one. My percentage lessens. Whites become fire, fire becomes blood, blood becomes placenta cast out from below. I swell in one place, and in another, I am barren.</p>
<p class="noindent">No strength. Weak with meat and sadness. A black beast, orifices swollen at all times from eye to clitoris. I am at the silent door of exile, how to take the first step?</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-07">Cooked</p>
<p class="noindent">In the name of Paris in the springtime</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the name of the tears shed by the prophets of God</p>
<p class="noindent">What do I do now that I&#8217;ve left my lover for a room with a view? I&#8217;m alone in this Paris hotel, drunk and waiting. Dervish, where is your arc of return? Where is the source of my flavour? The source of that which enriches. I remember the day when you first appeared to me in the tavern. All smooth and working a mean conga. Slim and dangerous. A grazing of your fingers on my right arm and the cooking began. You scooped me up in rituals I hadn&#8217;t known before. Fed me meals of such divinity&#8212;and I&#8217;m known for my gluttony. The divorce made me ugly. It increased my waist size. Created arms that did nothing above my head, served only to lift bread and chocolate and liquor to lips. Bread and chocolate and liquor to lips. I tried hard not to be at the mercy of fragments, food or yesterday&#8217;s mental actions but</p>
<p class="noindent">In the name of Paris in the springtime</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the name of the tears shed by the prophets of God</p>
<p class="noindent">What do I do now that I am a solitary traveller, and a poor one at that, hiding under a crust of cautionary sense? A woman in the possible violence of night in new countries. Even old churches here sport gargoyles projected from above to watch over you. But I&#8217;ve got no one to watch my back but my own tattoo. I&#8217;m a pilgrim in new landscapes. Travel is a good ritual, like prayer. They are both examples designed to calm the body, focus the heart. Rituals are reminders. Our movement from gross to subtle. <em>Inshallah</em>, we find the most beautiful ones but</p>
<p class="noindent">In the name of Paris in the springtime</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the name of the tears shed by the prophets of God</p>
<p class="noindent">What do I do now? I will carry myself up from the ocean floor &#8217;cause I got me energy since you closed the door! I will leave the city at full moon. Leave the mistrals, the columns of dog droppings on winding streets, gargoyles at every head thrown back. Gargoyles ain&#8217;t all that! They are lost lovers jutting from memory with jaws open, ready to get fat. Keep the memory solid. Use as a tool to remove garbage from the Straight Path. Let the gargoyles keep their watch in all their uniqueness and wrath. This magic is real. It comes from my heart, it fills out my hands. It stirs the spoon in the pot, the pencil on the page. It prevents the rot, burns the lead away. This burning is real. There is no end to it, and this burning eventually becomes sweet but</p>
<p class="noindent">In the name of Paris in the springtime</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the name of the tears shed by the prophets of God</p>
<p class="noindent">I go round and round in this pot you threw me in, and I thought I could swim. Now you&#8217;re no longer the chef and I look up to see who&#8217;s stirring and it&#8217;s the hand of God working the spoon of me. I see now, this is the meal of me that I offer as alms. The more I get cooked, the tastier I become. And so I let myself be seized. None of this can be undone. I submit myself to True Love, so that the meal of me can belong to everyone.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-08">Seclusion</p>
<p class="noindent">After three days I climb down from the attic and straight into the middle of a protest against the rise of the far right. Swept up inside one million people occupying boulevard St. Michel with fists punched upward, placards and cries sounding out &#8220;No to fascism! No to fascism!&#8221; Beating drums a blend of European and North African rhythms. A call for the reordering of order. The cry eternal since cities. Thousands of riot police at the ready. We have seen this before.</p>
<p class="noindent">The scope of human breath alone fills me with fear. From inside the masses I aim my gaze above the crowd. Look! Chimerical birds perched on their moons. They know I am still alive. Cursed hybrids, upscale monsters sitting coy on Notre Dame&#8217;s fa&#231;ade. They offer only a gallery of hell above an arc of flying buttresses.</p>
<p class="noindent">I don&#8217;t want anyone&#8217;s looking. I want solitude, intoxication, love from those who reject me and love for those who deserve me. There is an order which surpasses. What is it?</p>
<p class="noindent">Wasn&#8217;t there a young man beside me a second ago who made my sex resound? Now hirsute in full view. I am witness to my first silver pubic hair. He missed out. Too bad I had cast him out of l&#8217;Hotel de M&#233;dicis, or did he cast me?</p>
<p class="noindent">Everything that occurs becomes poetry, whether by crime or accident. Even my hatred is transformed. The laws of love may elude, but I will get through this theatre, this flower of folly.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-09">This Work of Destruction</p>
<p class="noindent">I leave one Left Bank for another. Avignon is surrounded by thick, stern walls and massive towers. No one will find me here. I am papal deep inside the beige commune, protected even from a flooding Rh&#244;ne. Inside the medieval ramparts, high on Rocher des Doms, safe behind bars.</p>
<p class="noindent">Within city walls, I am free to move around clandestine among craft market stalls at Place de l&#8217;Horloge. I turn down a slim, stone lane peppered with mopeds, and emerge at the house of popes. White pigeons pursue black pigeons in the courtyard of honour and all miss my head by an inch. I look left, right. Still no sign of Shams. Seven days have passed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Le Palais des Papes is bellicose, corpulent, a monument to awe and fear. Halls of gothic proportion. Architectures of genocide. Opulence at all expense. Torture, worship and luxury all spoken in the same barbaric breath. My lineage of ghosts tugging at both coattails, working hard to make me remember the ones who lost the war, the ones written out of the story, the ones taken away. The many sides to one story.</p>
<p class="noindent">The children of German tourists run ahead of me, then behind me, and then ahead again through endless galleries. They point at me, giggling. My brown body, black locks moving and not moving among the spirits. Gliding less than visible through twenty-five dining halls, changing rooms, dungeons and chapels of bloody history that have both enslaved me and are my family. Rooms are repeated. I look right, left. Still no sign of Shams.</p>
<p class="noindent">Only pale children with axes peering down at me from proud paintings. Short-legged revolutionaries with misshapen noses holding steadfast onto swords. I escape to the medicinal gardens when suddenly, a naked, muscular, porcelain Jesus appears above with arms outstretched in statuesque suffering. We are all in want of touch and service.</p>
<p class="noindent">I look up. Still no sign. I look back. The fortress, a work of destruction. Empty, too big for itself, out of use and useless if not shared. But it accepts my celibacy and melancholy with open arms today, even as I am nailed to my own ego. The remedy is death. But how to complete the task?</p>
<p class="noindent">Find a new skin for the old ceremony. <em>La Alla LaLa</em> said the voice from the other side of the story. Any cloaked poet would approve.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-10">Eurafrican</p>
<p class="noindent">Studying the charts again to assess my position on Earth, it was now May and I moved quick from commune to coast. When you don&#8217;t know where to go and the motherland is right beside you, there is no choice. Only African descent asking to be the future. The pilgrimage, the risk of no-risk, an arc of diasporic return.</p>
<p class="noindent">As soon as I stepped aboard <em>The Marrakesh</em>, I went missing between S&#232;te and Tangiers in torn skin. The ferry moved without moving. Disappearing coastline was the only indication of in-betweenness. In the constant wind, my senses caught fire and seeped through the skin.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ship&#8217;s engines roared and we heaved into Mediterranean past trawlers from Istanbul, Cape Town, Port-aux-Fran&#231;ais and Singapore. Passengers on deck waved as wind poured through the cloth openings. Muslim robes took flight. I exchanged one continent for another, again.</p>
<p class="noindent">Rock of Gibraltar to starboard, Moroccan Rif Mountains to port, an African daughter returning home with faded complexion, a failure at love but free, despite a clutching ego and wandering coins in the pocket.</p>
<p class="noindent">I gave France a parting prayer but the French passengers interrupted with volume alone. A high-timbred attitude attained only with a sound passed down through generations. Everyone sounds louder when you are silent. I am a stranger to both tourists of conspicuous consumption and family tables of ten. So many robed women and men around me seem content, the waiter even more so. Ya Mustafa! Remind me this peace.</p>
<p class="noindent">Solitude escapes me with every bat of the eyelash, every turn of the head. I tried for it in the corner of the small, four-person cabin but people followed me even there. We swayed on internal seas for two days, our windowless room smelled of feet and women whispering. But when the others left, their rose scent subsided and my own foul musk remained.</p>
<p class="noindent">I resorted to self-mutilation and self-worship all at once. Checked my mutating countenance in a discreet compact, attracting no attention but that of God. I applied bronze dust with annoyance and vanity over my shifting blemishes. Should I have abandoned the medicine for my skin in Miami? Are these sores acceptable? Light comes into play again. How does it affect the cheek, the forehead? Are my acne scars visible roots? Are the protrusions visible in these shadows? I have all the side effects and still the original condition. Everything dry, cracked, blood at the edge, philtrum red, womb ruined. Side effects forever. Who will offer remedy for my pains? My vain condition is turning me into a prisoner, and what to do in a prison but write.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-11">Burst</p>
<p class="noindent">The call to prayer came early this morning. Two German tourists ate shakshuka and drank Stork beer in their stupor after having been awakened by it at five a.m. Loudspeakers amplified the <em>azan</em> from the mosque off Plaza Uta El-Hamman. <em>Fajr</em> is not for infidels or unbelievers, but I cannot be certain, I am still sleeping.</p>
<p class="noindent">This Rif mountain shields itself in cloud and homes are painted lunar blue. Chefchaouen is a heaven for tourism and inner worlds alike. The language barrier is a rich, obstacled Riffian Berber. I took a room in the medina.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;The time for women in the hammam is now,&#8221; said the living image of my Antiguan grandfather, shoveling perfumed cedar into the oven as I walked past.</p>
<p class="noindent">There was a cold which touched bone that morning. The bow of defeat, the curved tree, the hanging mirror on a whitewashed wall, slippery cobblestones lend themselves well to a fallen glance from an indigo man in a snow white djellaba.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;This is the land of God!&#8221; said Mustafa, refilling my teacup from most high. If I were well, I would invite him to sit with me and sip mint tea under this shy, textiled overhang. There is enough space in this cloud for all, I see it.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a burst I find all music, all senses, all humours, as all blood, phlegm, choler and melancholy escape unwarranted. Be silent now, I say to myself. Observe and allow yourself to be observed. Leave the common skin to itself. Be modest. Look, don&#8217;t touch. Listen.</p>
<p class="noindent">O women! Limit not your movements. Lift your robes and run into the mountains! Shriek in response to Barbary apes and <small>ALLAH</small>! We are here! We are gold! Give us only a little Truth serum and we shall release ourselves unto you, O Great Spirit of Creativity.</p>
<p class="noindent">May these troubles invite you into life as a poetic event with each tiny movement fundamental to the next. We move from sea to sun to inner space. There is a secret knowledge inside the body framework. The corporeal disappears. The secret remains. Throw this scent of joy and death to all on the Path.</p>
<p class="noindent">Floating on the gathered pebbles now, Shams is whirling above and Atlantic gallops below, I am undulating on the pavement, or perhaps Mustafa&#8217;s put something in the tea.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-12">Shams, the Bird</p>
<p class="noindent">Forty days passed and still no sign of Shams. I laid down the blue shawl and pulled on the black. Both of us twenty-eight when we met at the tavern and, by thirty, Shams had left me there alone to discover the real meaning of intoxication. My own alcoholism was only a precursor.</p>
<p class="noindent">None of my friends liked him. I couldn&#8217;t understand why, nor did I care. I was in a parallel universe. Fallen inside one person outside of time for years. The kind of love story that cannot last with one person, but can last without one. Impact itself comes later to all who survive the initial blow.</p>
<p class="noindent">Shams stroked my bare shoulder with his edge of hand one night at Bukowski&#8217;s Bar on the Drive in Vancouver and I never again wanted anything more. We sometimes made love six times a day. There was poetry in all of our actions. My face was clean, body strong, a perfume of youth and immortality about the place. Nothing in this world but him. Nothing in the next.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to be worshipped?&#8221; Shams had asked one rainy afternoon after making love. I could not answer. Only he could render me both eloquent and speechless.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to visit some friends tomorrow. Do you want to come?&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">With Shams, everything was yes. His breath, wisteria before the hummingbird has come to it. Musk, a touch of rose and pine after the rains. Honeyed mint and rich, a maple syrup salmon on the fingertips pressed to nose after acts of love. His body needed my touch, his head, my hand on the temples, his smell, my sense of it.</p>
<p class="noindent">It was a modest, church-like building on a Friday afternoon in spring 2001. The Quaker Meeting House lay unassuming under grey skies, giant cedar branches reaching up into a sprinkle of rain. Coast Salish is its own kind of cool and moist. We ducked into the back basement door, and everything went quiet. Passed through a large, old-fashioned dining room and kitchen.</p>
<p class="noindent">Like a glutton, I ate everything, but Shams received the taste. I ate the thunderclap of him. The storm I missed the night before in my sleep, the madness of it. The surrender. The essential oil. Call it what you will, without belief, without faith, call it only with absurdity! Call it love on all levels of cells, gustatory or otherwise. This is the way I want to live. This ceaseless prayer. A constant surprise. The way Shams would arrive unannounced at the office ready to make love on the desk once everyone had gone home. The surprise party, saffron walls, a new world of music, the love poems, the poetry of the Sufis. The music that unlocked in me. All of our golden sections at once. The gaze and the freedom like a clever rubbing of hands.</p>
<p class="noindent">I followed Shams up the narrow, vintage flight of stairs. The landing opened onto a spacious hall where dozens of people sat on carpets and sheepskins on the smooth wooden floor. At the far end, two long-haired, mustached men were speaking in a tongue I did not recognize. Shams and I approached, I held onto him tight. He put his hand to his heart and bowed slightly before the men; they did the same. One of them glanced at me with Lightning. And then we sat down beneath the giant bay windows. When the elder spoke, his companion would translate from Turkish to English. He asked if anyone in the room had a dream to tell. I disappeared.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without a word, Shams had brought me to a gathering of Sufis. I never left that room. I am in that room and that room is in me. It is the tavern that was sought all along. Home, but not just yet.</p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps this was not magic. Even Shams, the magician had quit the area and only the tools were left behind: drums, a reed flute, sheepskin, songbooks. I, the result of moving weapons, rhythmic with white powder, muscle, focus and the unpreventable. What creation is within us! What tones! Astronomical perfections were achieved with Shams: prediction, remembrance, flight, alchemy, Absolute Music of Life. <em>Proportiones Musicae</em>. I can&#8217;t remember why my eyes followed you, or how I knew you were well. I can&#8217;t remember why my eyes followed you, or how I knew you were well.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-13">The Mohammedan</p>
<p class="noindent">Crossing the Ras el Maa, Amazigh women washed clothes by the shore and eyed me with due suspicion. I climbed into the mountain overlooking the powdered blue cubes of Chefchaouen.</p>
<p class="noindent">The footpath was strewn with pale pink rosebay, poppies and occasional mint, at times the high grasses swallowed us up along the slim, earthen upward arc like a pebbled wave. One by one, men sitting sedentary by the path or descending the mountain took sexual aim. I moved past, trying not to invite or excite. Climbed hurriedly up the Rif.</p>
<p class="noindent">Placing a foot inside a derelict Spanish mosque, the twelfth century ruined walls were peppered with cobalt graffiti. Roofless, the sky was in full view. Sun giving everything away. There was a spot among the rocks and as I settled in to let the star do its business, a man walked out of cloud a stone&#8217;s throw away from me.</p>
<p class="noindent">He was sunken-cheeked and slim. Trim, black beard and skin the colour of Medjool dates. A white cotton shirt, dark emerald vest and small leather bag across the chest, his black turban had the end hanging down between the shoulder blades.</p>
<p class="noindent">He stood immobile with his back to me, catching his breath after the rugged walk uphill. Turning, he startled and approached, gently. I held out an open bag of fresh figs.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;As-salamu alaykum,&#8221;</em> he greeted, putting his hand to his heart before plucking a fig from the bag.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Wa alaykumu s-salam,&#8221;</em> I replied.</p>
<p class="noindent">Mohammed was a weaver from a family of weavers who spoke Spanish, Arabic and a dialect of Riffian Berber. We sat together outside the ruined mosque and conversation had barely begun when he removed a long, tan, leather pouch from his bag. Two wooden pipes and a red clay bowl fit tightly together to make one long sebsi. He dipped the bowl into a tiny sack of sticky hashish, lit the end away from wind, sucked quick and heavy, then passed the sebsi to me. Strong and sweet, rich and fragrant with mint. Afternoon deepened and my lips cracked bloody in the stark rays. We ate figs that melted in the mouth like warm strawberry jam and sat sprawled in the cradling sun.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I was born in the year of the elephant,&#8221; he recounted. &#8220;My father died before I was born. When I was still a baby, I was sent to live in the desert with a Bedouin family. When I was still very young, my mother also died. Then, my grandfather and uncle took me in and raised me. We were very poor. I did not starve, but in the end, I traveled, went looking for knowledge in faraway places.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Mohammed removed a small reed flute from his shirt pocket and began to play. Quarter tones in actual air. Time elastic and the call to prayer arrived late that day, it was already past four. Mohammed excused himself, stood up from the rock, walked a short distance and paused. He turned left and right. Set his vest on the ground, and began the <em>salat</em> prayer.</p>
<p class="noindent">A young boy joined him. When Mohammed bowed, the young boy bowed, and when he stood up straight, so did the boy. They both prostrated, and I too, prostrated inside myself.</p>
<p class="noindent">The day glistened. Mohammed plucked his vest from the grass and returned to sit beside me. The boy disappeared. We continued talking as before, but now each breath was a new worship. Today was the day for prayer, not for the future, nor the past, but for the All Invisible Present.</p>
<p class="noindent">We hiked down the mountain into town through the cemetery. Calm, azure headstones were arranged perpendicular to Mecca. The wind increased around us and my indigo shawl exploded wing-like in the lush green Rif. Children played soccer alongside the graves.</p>
<p class="noindent">We arrived at a domed door in the blue medina. Mohammed&#8217;s home was crowded and cavernous both. One cube of natural light shone through the front door window to illuminate the vast, single room. On the far wall, two couches and a low table; to the left, a tiny kitchen counter and hotplate. There was no washroom or running water. The far wall was piled high with textiles of all sizes and colours. At the centre of everything, a large, wooden, four-poster, hand-operated loom that reached the ceiling.</p>
<p class="noindent">We smoked kif in the illuminated black. Suddenly, Mohammed jumped up swift and eager. Entering the loom from beneath, he climbed into the walled-in bench and began to explain its inner workings, the intertwined harps of Yemeni cotton, the beauty of Omani thread, linen and green floss silk.</p>
<p class="noindent">Settling in at the helm, Mohammed plucked the neatly folded apron before him, tied it ritually around his waist, closed his eyes and took a deep breath. All at once, his whole muscular body activated the loom with the ease of a concert pianist. A ceremony of speed, agility, push and pull instrumental, the loom beating out a slow rhythmic pattern. Practical magic, austere and religious. He transformed the cotton into a pattern of red and black stripes, like all traditional Yemeni cloths. Mohammed became an active metaphor, hitting keys just right, Earth itself in rotation on its axis. I became hypnotized. The <em>azan</em> sounded, <em>&#8220;Allaaaaaaahu Akbar!&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="noindent">It was time. Mohammed reached for a striped silver and blue textile. As he covered me with the cloak, he whispered, &#8220;It is a fountain of magic and power.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">We walked side by side for a moment into the night until <em>as-salamu alaykum</em> Mohammed disappeared. I never saw him again.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-14">Hassan&#8217;s Tower</p>
<p class="noindent">Riding an early morning bus to Rabat, something happened to my face en route. Although I struggled not to speak or draw attention to myself, oil seeped out of me unannounced. In the North African heat, I developed a strange rash&#8212;bright red pustules sliced themselves across both cheeks down to the chin, like burns.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the mirror, the sight of my own face frightened me. I considered staying indoors out of embarrassment. The face of God, ashamed of itself.</p>
<p class="noindent">At the time of my affair with Shams, I had smooth, simple skin, the product of pharmaceuticals. The day of our separation, my condition returned. <em>Une chance que je l&#8217;ai quitt&#233; &#224; temps. Mais dommage que cette peau de lait noire ne soit pas &#233;ternelle</em>. Good thing I left him on time. But how unfortunate that this black milk skin is not timeless.</p>
<p class="noindent">I picked at the rash out of habit and sacrifice, then applied makeup to the tiny wounds. Held my head up just high enough and walked the city streets of white, sanitized Rabat looking for a woman-friendly restaurant. Men continued to accost, seeking company, seeking refuge. It took only one to intrude just right.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Bonsoir</em>, can I walk with you?&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">My head turned left and a tall man had materialized beside me. A master of youth, loose in blue jeans and a white, embroidered tunic, black hair gelled in place and a beard trimmed fresh, though I detected a disarming musk about him that was not from cologne. A player ready for all kinds of play.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Non, merci.&#8221;</em> No, thank you. I increased my pace and he did the same.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;N&#8217;ayez pas peur. Moi c&#8217;est Hassan. Et vous? Vous &#234;tes marocaine?&#8221;</em> I mean you no harm. I&#8217;m Hassan, and you? Are you Moroccan? &#8220;Where are you from? Wait, let me guess, Spain? <small>U.S.</small>? Is it your first time in Rabat? While you are here you must visit Hassan Tower. It&#8217;s dedicated to my ancest&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;You look like you&#8217;re dressed to go out on a date, my friend,&#8221; I blurted, interrupting him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t keep anyone waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Elle parle, Alhamdulillah! On prend un th&#233; ensemble?&#8221;</em> She speaks, Thank God! Can I invite you for tea? &#8220;Well, actually, I was going to meet some friends at a caf&#233;, it&#8217;s a mixed place, you would like it. Would you join me? My friends are very sweet except when they pull the rug from under you&#8230;&#8221; his voice trailed off and I took the opportunity to cross the street. He followed, still. &#8220;So tell me, what do you do?&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to be a writer,&#8221; I said, slightly defeated, slowing down now.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Aha! Si j&#8217;avais une feuille de papier vierge, je voudrais que vous y &#233;criviez tout ce que vous d&#233;sirez.&#8221;</em> If I had a blank sheet of paper, I would want you to write whatever you desired on it. He paused, grinning. &#8220;Are you married? I&#8217;ve been known to unmake marriages.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Please, I want to walk alone now.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Mais vous &#234;tes clairement int&#233;ress&#233;, et moi aussi. Je crois que vous &#234;tes charmante, mais pas belle; athl&#233;tique, mais gourmande.&#8221;</em> But you are clearly interested, and so am I. I believe you are charming, but not beautiful; athletic, but a glutton.</p>
<p class="noindent">I covered my head and ran quickly into night. Could hear his voice calling out from behind me as I crossed the street, <em>&#8220;Inshallah</em>, someone back home is looking out for your best interest, better than you yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">I ran to my old friends Solitude and Vanity no less, part conditioning, part condition. The <em>azan</em> sounded, nothing more&#8212;everything shifted, abated. Was I destined to get drunk in my room again? I didn&#8217;t come to the motherland for solitude.</p>
<p class="noindent">I must find some magic to repair this condition, this unease. What do I do aside from beg Shams in dark rooms on cold nights? Who am I even speaking to? I have no personal description. The tears keep breaking past the barrier, nothing human can contain them. I&#8217;ve forgotten how to pray, I am praying. Shams appears. Disappears.</p>
<p class="noindent">This work of living is bitter fruit. Cavernous empty. Try not to think, not to think, not to think. I&#8217;m only falling apart slightly now. It comes and goes little by little, you see, mostly in private. I&#8217;m not even present in this room. Just here to disappear. One day, a good feeling will again overwhelm, <em>Inshallah</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent">That night in the dream, Shams is wearing a yellow shirt. He enters and begins shouting at me, gesticulating, saying that my story is false and that he&#8217;s heard enough. I approach him and begin twisting his arm to make him believe. As I do this, I wake up.</p>
<p class="noindent">Next day the mirror showed no signs of the rash&#8212;it&#8217;s as if I had imagined it. The meaning of the message is lost, but the picture of it remains.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-15">False Grave</p>
<p class="noindent">Marrakesh is myth made tourist. The high-ringing tones of darbouka soared into air above as I walked undercover in the rhythmic medina camouflaged in the usual scars. The square of Jemaa el-Fnaa in afternoon Anti-Atlas sun is a lion always hungry. Public snakes entranced by sweet wind. Water-sellers in regalia free for photos. Hardcore acrobat troupes in human pyramids among robed elders and colonial imposters without fail or organization, but perfection nonetheless. I include myself. Which self? The African daughter or the ambiguous tourist? And just then sounds divine and scents overwhelming of burnt pigeon feathers, clay, cumin, chili, rose and white smoke intoxicated me. I would leave it all behind for what I had lost.</p>
<p class="noindent">I moved through Bahia Palace and the surrounding shops of sharp pyramid displays in cinnamon, turmeric and paprika. Fragrant dust piled conical high in defiance of gravity. Dry pepper and purple eggplant skin garlands hanging over cubes of musk, stained glass bottles of forest green and royal blue. I stopped in awe and the shopkeeper who greeted me knew nothing of spice or herbal medicine, but something of art.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;If you have time, I would be very glad to host you at my studio. It&#8217;s nearby,&#8221; he put forth, appearing to float inside his long white djellaba.</p>
<p class="noindent">Within minutes, I was following another man named Hassan down tall, narrow alleys of good, thick mud into the Mellah, the Jewish quarter. A walled city inside the city.</p>
<p class="noindent">He flowed as I followed awkwardly. He was in his forties, but appeared older due to a slight limp and some extra weight around the middle. No matter, his grace was compounded by lemon yellow babouches peeking out from underneath his long robe.</p>
<p class="noindent">We passed through the door of his studio and into a cool, dimly lit room. Uneven white walls domed a small sitting area. Pastel canvases, painted plates and Amazigh jewels covered every available surface. In the paintings were animals, human forms. The haram hidden inside abstracts.</p>
<p class="noindent">Hassan had studied visual arts and German literature in Berlin. He worked in the spice shop by day and painted by night with the support of friends and family.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Colour and shape are everything to me! This is my service. This is why I am alive.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">And with the propane stove and kettle at the ready, Hassan began the tea service as we settled in across from each other on pillows. Full cups, he lit the sebsi to open our afternoon.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;When I was born, my grandfather sacrificed a ram and gave it to the poor in the village. My mother shaved my head and gave the weight of my baby hair in silver as alms. Can you believe it?&#8221; he said, beginning to laugh, &#8220;I am bald now, but as a baby I had too much hair!&#8221; We both laughed.</p>
<p class="noindent">I inhaled more kif than I should have and my silence turned loud. I may have revealed too much. My heart lay bloody and broken, gross on short sleeves in the face of Hassan&#8217;s calm, internal landscape.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I speak to Shams through my own voice at night!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Can he hear me? What is happening? What is this? My chest hurts. I know that eventually I will have to stop speaking to him as if he were in the room, right? Why did he leave me? Where did he go?&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Hassan waited a long time before responding. I wept in the cool quiet room.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;You are going through something very beautiful. Once you surrender, you will be like a newborn. It&#8217;s good that you came to Morocco.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;You know, you would have liked my grandfather. He was an exceptional human being. He and my mother Fatima were very close. You remind me of her. When he died, he was mourned by many. But my mother was left alone in her grief for too long and it drew her so close to death that a few months later, death took her as well.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;On the day, she bathed, put on new clothes, lay down and passed&#8212;no ceremony, no prayers, no burial. At her request, there are several false graves to ensure that her true grave is never discovered. You have heard this story before but&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">There came a knock at the door and Hassan got up to answer. The story wasn&#8217;t finished! Indiscernible voices. An elderly couple entered the room holding a box of almond and rosewater pastries. Khadija, Mohammed, Hassan and I ate sweets and smoked bitter apple tobacco on charcoal, glowing. The rising steam bubbled as we inhaled soft, phenomenal and easy. Peace was no longer fleeting but held us firmly as we blushed near the fire. For a long time, no one spoke. After our meditation, Hassan rose and left the room. He never did finish the story.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before leaving, the elder Mohammed looked at me and said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know each other, you and I, but don&#8217;t worry, you will be all right. Stop crying. Go sit under a cedar and let old woman windchill dry your tears and cool down the interior of your fire. Clouds cover sun, but only for a moment in this garden prone to drought in the desert. Go back to work now. The world of fragrant orange, fig and olive blossom needs your service in order to bear fruit.&#8221;</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-16">Alive but Emptied of Self</p>
<p class="noindent">The Canary Current swayed wide and slow on its way south in the Atlantic distance. The African coastline of the diasporic imaginary all the way down to Senegal before heading back to the outer realms. Looking down over the ramparts, a party of four tourists walked along the beach past the stationary dromedaries in windy Essaouira. They looked tired and hungry but well. Well-fed and dressed with fattened wallets and skin stretched taut and leathery. Even as the men pulled ahead, the women held steadfast onto them&#8212;to let go was divorce. I will not let go.</p>
<p class="noindent">At dusk, I found a spot on the beach and got my own whipping from the falling sun. Moved onto blackened boulders to get near crashing current. The tide came toward me in white, foamed shadows. White waves with arms overthrown, heads back&#8212;ever seen a wave like that? Mouths crying open at the fattened half-moon, flinging themselves onto wet sea stones as night covered us all. That Friday wailed of Shams. If I want to keep you, I must use you. Blacken you better than the night, or rather like red snapper, limed, slightly battered, maize then fire to mouth.</p>
<p class="noindent">After sundown, I found a small family restaurant beneath the sea wall with low tables that only went up as high as the knee. As I folded myself to eat Legnaoui&#8217;s <em>tajine de poisson marin&#233;e</em>, a middle-aged American tourist changed seats to sit near me. He got brazen quick by diving straight into tall tales of windsurfing without even asking my name.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;So, I&#8217;ve been all up and down the coast from Taghazout. A place called Killer Point has <small>THE</small> best waves. One time I had a killer whale right beside me. I tell ya, I screamed like a little girl, my adrenaline shot so high. Hey, do you like fig liqueur?&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">I forged a complaint about the food to get him to leave me alone but at that moment, he touched my leg under the table. I froze and disappeared.</p>
<p class="noindent">Was it a dream or a prediction? I reentered the world a few months earlier, among the streets around Plaza de la Constituci&#243;n as they congested on a warm February day. Shams and I had descended from the Palenque jungles into a Mexico City whose Congress was blocked with cows and a thousand cowboy hats. Farmers were protesting the costs of <small>NAFTA.</small></p>
<p class="noindent">A large, thickly mustached man had sat down at the table where Shams had left me for a moment. The wide sweat stains around his arms and chest darkened his blue shirt. He tipped his cowboy hat in my direction.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;&#161;Hola guapa! Sabes que aqu&#237; en M&#233;xico estamos acostumbrados a las protestas y marchas pol&#237;ticas. No te preocupes.&#8221;</em> Hello beautiful! You know here in Mexico City we are used to protests and political marches. Don&#8217;t you worry about it.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;<em>&#191;De donde eres? &#191;Est&#225;s sola? &#191;Te puedo ofrecer una bebida?&#8221;</em> Where are you from? Are you alone? Can I buy you a drink?</p>
<p class="noindent">The protesters shouted in unison, <em>&#8220;&#161;Zapata vive! &#161;La lucha sigue!&#8221;</em> Zapata lives! The fight continues!</p>
<p class="noindent">The sirens sounded, the man&#8217;s voice intensified and loudspeakers joined in. Suddenly Shams returned to save me from purchase. He touched my leg under the table. It is the only touch I want.</p>
<p class="noindent">At that moment in Essaouira, I swallowed the lump in my throat and removed the American man&#8217;s hand from my thigh. I returned to my meal though it was now bubbling inside my stomach. Without a word, he had secretly ordered fig liqueur for the both of us, and when it arrived at the table, I was hit all at once with a swell of nausea. I ran away.</p>
<p class="noindent">Barely up the stairs of l&#8217;Hotel Majestic, when a torrent of saffron mud poured violent out of my mouth and all over the floor of the communal bathroom. A full-bodied flood directed outward&#8212;an exorcism, a wound excised.</p>
<p class="noindent">The stranger had activated my flight response. Triggered old trauma. The body was still rejecting events. What had happened with Shams could not be absorbed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Acute fever and chills overwhelmed me. I swallowed two tablets of activated charcoal and lay down. Shivering, burning, confused with fire and freezing, I tried to sleep under layers of clothing and blankets. After some time, the nausea returned and my cheeks ballooned as I ran to the sink in my room. This time the bile was black. I fell back to bed, unconscious.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-17">Dream of a Poet</p>
<p class="noindent">In the dream, my friend the poet Zeechilla the Great had been locked in a closet and was pounding on the door to get out. I opened it but he remained inside with his back toward me, his hands tied behind him. Suddenly his head was twisted around to face me. His bearded mouth moved without a sound, dark eyes wide with surprise. Then his head spun back to normal, but his eyes remained fixed on me, unattached to the face. I began to untie the rope around his wrists and thought that, perhaps, all of this was not natural.</p>
<p class="noindent">Next morning, I received news that Zeechilla had passed away in Vancouver from unknown causes. It turned me immobile. A poet burning. Someone dipped me in fire. I did not melt, but my skin sizzled. Sores began to form at the surface, glorious red-hot sunspots pulling hair from face. The entire process barely took the eye away from evil. What is it in me, that feels so close to death?</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-18">Old Medicine</p>
<p class="noindent">Bread for breakfast and vomit for dinner, the next three days were light in protein and dark in bile. I checked my waistline in the mirror&#8212;it remained thick. I threw my shoulders back for good measure and took smaller, lighter steps. Head just high enough. There was satisfaction in waiting for the purge to end, to being alive and witness to it.</p>
<p class="noindent">I could feel a cold coming on as I entered the labyrinthine Essaouira spice souk. Sat down to discourse with the mighty Hakim of the inner circle of apothecaries. Hakim was bewitching, in his early twenties with a wise way about him that was still in development. Tall and lithe with seamless skin the colour of hickory, his beige skullcap rested slightly to one side and his whole blue-robed body followed. A man of gentle ways, he would gaze upward when listening in order to provide the most beautiful answer. He did this now, thought for a long moment before giving me any medicine.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Prends ces grains de nigelle avec du miel. &#199;a te gu&#233;rira. Le proph&#232;te lui-m&#234;me, Ras&#363;l All&#257;h Muhammad &#8216;alayhi s-sal&#257;m, en a parl&#233;.&#8221;</em> Take this black seed with honey. It will heal you. The prophet himself, Muhammad, peace be upon him, spoke about it.</p>
<p class="noindent">I pressed the tiny nigella seeds to my nostrils and inhaled. Black dots of purifying eucalyptus. Next day, my cold had disappeared and the vomiting ended, though the nausea remained.</p>
<p class="noindent">In my old age, I turn to old medicine. In return, this encourages young merchants to be confident and seek out older women as possible lovers. Young man, this will greatly enrich you, while also preventing your hand from touching my breast or perhaps inviting it there.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Ici, c&#8217;est la terre de Dieu,&#8221;</em> said Hakim, filling my teacup from most high without yielding a drop to the table. This is the land of God.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-19">Husayn&#8217;s Museum</p>
<p class="noindent">It was high midday heat when I entered the window-less studio in underground Essaouira. At the narrow entrance, round mirrors hung on either side, each framed with metal, stone, blood and bone&#8212;it was not a shop at all. The inner room was sweeping. Rough, whitewashed walls covered with lances and morning stars, aged gold coins and leather saddles, goat skins and faded maps of the Euphrates.</p>
<p class="noindent">A man knelt immobile at the far end of the cool room. An elongated green djellaba, forehead to the ground in prostration. He did not pause. As he bowed, I bowed inside myself. He was entranced.</p>
<p class="noindent">What rose from prayer and moved toward me was a beautiful, androgynous Black man, head shaved bald and a face of finely sculpted features with a faint goatee around the mouth. An air of fire and vigour about him, he was quick to charm, claiming an attraction to me in very few words. I responded. He invited me to sit for mint tea and baklava. I could not come to food but it was coming to me. My nausea gave thanks.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ali was a scribe, I could see the open Quran beside a blank manuscript with the beginnings of long, syrupy handwritten strokes of Arabic calligraphy on the top right.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;All of these artefacts you see here are open secrets,&#8221; he said, pointing. &#8220;Gold leaf Qurans, prayer rugs, arrows&#8230; This is what remains from the battle of Karbala.&#8221; His voice rose and his body straightened.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;As soon as our souls part from our bodies, you will find out who is most worthy of entering the fire!&#8221;</em> he recited with passion.</p>
<p class="noindent">I did not understand. I froze inside myself. Ali became calm and poured water gently on a small red-berried plant in the corner.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Mistletoe. Some parts are poisonous, but the fruits are harmless to birds. Birds gorge themselves and shit the seed wherever their two wings take them. The seeds stick to branches and grow there, taking root wherever they fall. One supports the other. Two wings, <em>un oiseau.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="noindent">A ginger kitten approached and Ali took it in his arms, set it back down near its mother. He poured hot mint tea into our glass cups from high above. The colours in the room changed.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I was born inside a rock,&#8221; he said, gazing at some upward vanishing point, &#8220;I stayed there with my mother for three days. I don&#8217;t remember this of course, but it&#8217;s what they tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">He reached for a polished bottle made of camel bone and opened it. The scent of ambergris filled the room with heady perfume.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unconsciously, I reached for it, but &#8220;This is not for sale,&#8221; said Ali, his voice lush. &#8220;Everything here belongs to all of us, freely.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">I began to rise and as I did, he stole a kiss. I liked it. Mistletoe. True, his touch was unwarranted, and I was between two worlds on the matter. Though it meant nothing, it was the first intimate touch since the disappearance of Shams.</p>
<p class="noindent">I was sometimes unsure how to answer these gestures. I thought they were sexual advances but acted as if it were friendship. Always some momentary confusion when faced with a lion of God. Most of the time however, advances were balanced with a gentle kindness and a seductive ability to pour tea. A blend of Islam and virility. Restrained and hedonist both. The finest line. A dot.</p>
<p class="noindent">Stricken again with old nausea, I moved toward the door, but Ali prevented me from leaving.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;What&#8217;s yours will find you,&#8221;</em> said a voice that was not his. It came from somewhere behind the walls.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; said Ali, stepping aside. Quickly, I ran away.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-20">Spitting Image</p>
<p class="noindent">The choir of muezzins gave the <em>al-maghrib</em> and took the town into painted dusk. A fattened moon hung low above the fish market jetty. Thick, alkali smoke from outdoor grill stands flew up carrying the scent of char and sardines into night. Seagulls screamed with glee at fish guts and tones of Maghrebi Arabic did business by the side of the path.</p>
<p class="noindent">Walking further down to the tip of the jetty everything turned quiet, the fishing boats swayed and old men looked silently out onto Atlantic.</p>
<p class="noindent">Returning up the crescent of the port, the Sqala du Port appeared at the place where the peninsula meets land. A bastion that sold slaves descended from Bilal. Sons of Bambara. Gnawa. Different fort but same trade, like all the human traffic stops up and down this West African coastline and up the other side.</p>
<p class="noindent">Just then a haggard, blue-eyed, blond dreadlocked man shuffled up beside me and began a verbal assault. I asked to be left alone. He threw his venom high, shouting that he despised all foreigners and that I was racist. He spat on me and stomped away.</p>
<p class="noindent">I did not react. Kept walking, wiping the saliva from my cheek inside my heart, throwing aside the sword, restraining the inner fight. Soon after, a new stranger pulled up alongside and apologized. He alleged that his friend was drunk and not in control of his actions. Kept my eyes dead ahead. Retired to my rented room. Your body does not command me.</p>
<p class="noindent">That night I tightened my locks in a gesture of protection. Took my time twisting each nappy rope into a Bantu knot. Slept with my head pulled tight. Next day at the unravelling, the locks fell on my shoulders in power ringlets, a separate helix each. <small>DNA</small> reaching out. Tiny whirling dervishes about the head. A coil of snakes sheathed and bulletproof, ready to conjure, turn you into stone. It was my birthday.</p>
<p class="noindent">I returned to Hakim who had become a confidante overnight and he placed a gris-gris around my neck&#8212; three small leather pouches of yellow sulfur enclosing an inscription from the Quran to ward off evil.</p>
<p class="noindent">As he hung the charm on me, an elder passed by and bent forward. Waving a tattooed, arthritic finger, she said, &#8220;Ce <em>gris-gris l&#224;, il est bon pour la magie noire et la magie blanche. Baraka Allahu feek.&#8221;</em> That gris-gris there is good for black magic and white magic. May God bless you. Then she turned and walked away waving her hand. Her milk apricot breath lingered long after she had gone.</p>
<p class="noindent">Next evening, I made my way up the ramparts again at sunset and saw men drunk in the streets because wives would not have such behaviour in the home. They hiccupped and threw up gently on the crowded blue fishing boats occupying the port. Navy night descended over the Citadel.</p>
<p class="noindent">The man who had spat on me approached, skittish, asking forgiveness. I began to walk faster and he sped up to me, promised not to bother me again, then let go.</p>
<p class="noindent">I knew it was time to leave. A sphere had appeared around me. Where I had been rough, the trade winds had softened, smoothed my skin, relaxed me into myself. Wingspan, the sensation of hovering&#8212;even for a moment. Effortless effort. Gliding freedom. Accepting of change, living without expectation, only surprise.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-21">Lands are Joined at the Handle</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Every day is September 11th,&#8221; said the White Rock, British Columbia border guard on that cold January morning when our travels first began. He wouldn&#8217;t let us cross the <small>U.S.</small>-Canada boundary with our DriveAway car&#8212;didn&#8217;t believe we would actually return it to its owners in Palm Springs. Shams and I had put our lives into storage and taken the road south with only a plan to wander.</p>
<p class="noindent">We stared wide-eyed at the framed Peace Arch behind him. A hard snow fell to the Coast Salish ground outside as we waited in the clenched, slate grey building to enter the neighbour&#8217;s yard.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Your papers are not in order. Who are the car-owners? How long are they staying in the <small>U.S.</small>? What is a DriveAway again?&#8221; The guard turned blue in the face to match his uniform.</p>
<p class="noindent">After three hours, the thing resolved itself and we made it past the longest undefended border in the world. Hugged the 1-5 straight into a live Cuban music concert in Seattle that baptismal night, our motel room full of sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">From one fast-food meal to another, we drove south until Palm Springs opened her desolate gates of golf courses and wind farms in jeweled outlines of sand. A mid-century man-made oasis in the desert. Curious attempts at masking the Absolute. We returned the car to its retired orange-grove owners and pulled out a map. Mexico, Cuba, Mali&#8230; I had only wanted to travel the world with my beloved, location was unimportant. Our plans were not our plans at all. His agenda remained hidden, even from himself. First Mexico, then the wind. I should have seen the signs instead of only looking at them.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-22"><em>Vall&#233;e des Roses</em></p>
<p class="noindent">By June, the giant damask rose outside El-Kela&#226; M&#8217;Gouna was in full late bloom. Thousands of pink Syrian blossoms edged the highway. When we arrived at the end of the line, I was the last person out the van. The High Atlas Mountains were bone dry, air thick with pungent rose from the valley below. Kasbahs ruined and valleys succulent, palm trees rose from rose. I descended ochre rock into the narrow valley of green palm, thorns and heady, blushing petals. A naked boy stopped scrubbing his feet by the riverbanks of Assif n Im&#8217;Goun to point me out to his friends. Swimming children stopped their play and laughed. This did nothing to affect me as I floated drunk inside the fragrance of roses that had taken afternoon sun.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without warning, an older, white-turbaned man in a brown suit jacket appeared from behind the bushes. He lurched at me extending a bouquet of fresh picked roses, slurring his words.</p>
<p class="noindent">Quickened my step to keep him at bay but he would not leave me alone. I ran. He grabbed at me, missed, grabbed again. Shouting in Arabic, his breath reeked of alcohol. And then a child came down from the time of Muhammad to save me.</p>
<p class="noindent">The child&#8217;s name, I later learned, was Jibril, whose beauty alone immobilized the drunken man. Jibril took my hand, kissed it, then pulled me away among the bushes into the valley. The man stood, lurking. He soon disappeared into the pink as Jibril led me home in the clouds through sandstone, stream and edge of valley, every step an upward escape.</p>
<p class="noindent">Twelve years old and running swift across the land in a long blue skirt and flying fuchsia headscarf. On the other side of the pass, Jibril opened the courtyard gate and we entered a long, apricot-scented garden of tall raspberry hollyhock and oleander. Walked through to the far end and into a long rectangular room with high-beamed ceilings and walls of red mud and crossed straw&#8212; African wattle-and-daub architecture of the entire world. Removed our shoes and sat in a corner on carpets and pillows against the cool wall.</p>
<p class="noindent">Jibril sat beside me, genderless. The sitting room became busy with family. Fertile grandmothers, cherub children with elderly faces&#8212;all quiet. We smiled at each other through our shyness.</p>
<p class="noindent">The only adult male at home that day was Adam. The eldest child of five and Jibril&#8217;s big brother, he had a strong scent of rose about him. A statuesque, mahogany man with the blushing cheeks of youth, he began the tea service with ease and ritual. Told me how he had been working with his mother in her rose distillery since the age of fourteen. They produced Damask rosewater and essential oil, so he always had that scent about him and so did she, though he barely noticed it now. At twenty, he was still rehearsing his role as head of household while his father was away on business, his mother always with the roses. He prepared the tea and was the only one who spoke with me the entire time, aside from Jibril who told me that I would never have children.</p>
<p class="noindent">Water boiled in the kettle for the gunpowder green. A tray of clear, cylindrical glasses appeared with a large pewter teapot. A heap of fresh spearmint was pushed inside and then slim shards of sugar were cut by cutlass from a crystalized loaf. Each step precise before the potion was poured from high without a single drop spilled. Perfect froth. Continuous cups. We drank and ate crusty, homemade khubz dipped in nutty argan oil.</p>
<p class="noindent">By the third cup, the family had dispersed and I was prompted to a smaller room for privacy and Camel Lights. Adam was an attractive man, but I didn&#8217;t like the way he invited me to lie down on his bed with him. He lay on the mattress while I sat cross-legged on the floor. Told him that I was reading a lot these days and had a copy of Rimbaud&#8217;s <em>Po&#233;sies</em> with me.</p>
<p class="noindent">Looking up at the ceiling he mused, &#8220;I like Camus and Verlaine well enough but my favourite book&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Le Pain Nu</em> by Mohamed Choukri,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You must read that book while you are here. Choukri left home at eleven to escape an abusive father and was very poor up in the northeast of the country. He was homeless for years on the streets of Tangiers until someone taught him to read and write in Arabic at the age of twenty. It took only one person to change his life. He was the age that I am now.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">At that moment, Jibril entered with a tray of wine, water and milk. Adam chose wine and I, milk. Jibril looked at Adam with solace then asked if I would come and play hide and seek. Adam rose from the mattress and invited me to stay the night or return the next day for a hike in the mountains. My skin spoke for me. And with that, he took my hand in his and placed in it a tiny bottle of oil. I bowed.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Making rose oil is a difficult process that can take a very long time. You have to give up sixty thousand petals in order to produce just one ounce of oil. But it&#8217;s worth it for the essence of the essence.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">The light was fading when Jibril and I made our way onto the path in the valley floor chewing licorice bark inside a crumbling Kasbah left to bake in the sun. The star lowered its head behind the High Atlas Mountains and, up the road, I could just make out the last minivan in the distance. Back at Kela&#226;, I could not remember the name of the village where I had just been nor could I find it on any map.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-23">Mother of Us All</p>
<p class="noindent">Next day I was the only woman in the streets by six p.m. After a bowl of roasted eggplant tajine, I rose from the warped plastic chair and slipped out the back door of <em>Restaurant Rendez-vous des Amis</em>. Seated outside, a robed figure looking out at the desert plateau. Her head turned at my arrival, a Nubian profile.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;As-salamu alaykum. Bonsoir. Moi c&#8217;est Hajar. Je vous en prie.&#8221;</em> She motioned to the chair beside her.</p>
<p class="noindent">Draped elegant in a dark djellaba and Tuareg blue headscarf, gold loop earrings dripping beside her face, Hajar was a striking woman. The sharpest cheekbones beneath kohl-lined eyes that looked sad yet defiant. Her youth, a regal quality.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Where are you from, sister?&#8221; she asked, smiling.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Quebec, Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Ha! I have never met an African from Canada,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;It must feel good in your heart to be back on African soil, <em>Mashallah</em>. Welcome home.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">I could not speak.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I&#8217;m a schoolteacher,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;But I miss Egypt terribly, my whole family is there. I came here to work on contract, to get some international work experience, but life is hard for women in Morocco. There is so little education, so little respect. Girls work in the fields and raise enormous families&#8212;this is both the beginning and the end. Some girls are completely used up and thrown away. At least the Kela&#226; rose harvest is led by women. They grow the rose and distil it. We need more of that and <em>more than</em> that&#8212;much more.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Hajar taught French, Arabic literature and Quran to children in a nearby village that did not allow any mixing of the unmarried or unrelated sexes. It was an Amazigh village steeped in Sharia law.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I can&#8217;t walk down the street beside a male colleague without starting a riot!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p class="noindent">She had come to Kela&#226; to escape both judgment and her Moroccan fianc&#233; with whom she had fallen out of love. She was undertaking an academic examination of marriage and he no longer measured up. Language and communication were her passions and her fianc&#233; was not interested in either.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I know he loves me deeply. It&#8217;s just that he was married before and is much older. Sometimes he takes advantage of our difference in age. I can&#8217;t seem to stand up to him. My own virginity and intellect are not enough. Will never be enough.&#8221; As if Muslim were fighting Muslim.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I am traveling to increase my trust in God and my wellbeing, but it is difficult, <em>Astaghfirullah</em>. Maybe this is the time for me to make Hajj. But I also just want to be married and be a mother and maybe even a grandmother someday. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">The stars had begun to give away their old light. We got up and walked down the main street together while men shot us bewildered looks for our lack of a male chaperone this late in the day. We continued talking about future travels&#8212;hers to Mecca and mine to Sahara. Both Absolute.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-24">Basic Mechanics</p>
<p class="noindent">Boumalne Dades was a small town on the edge of desert plateau. The kasbah, once a watchtower for the defensive was now a refuge for strangers. I set down my backpack in the cool room where the walls looked soft and pillowy at first glance but, upon deeper inspection, were solid masses of cracked, coral-red mud and dung flecked with straw.</p>
<p class="noindent">All the buildings here emerged from the soil, which emerged from the sea. This hotel, an extension of the naked rock. Perched overlooking the oasis, lush green forest stretched serpentine as far as all eyesight. Mars-like rust cliffs protecting us on either side.</p>
<p class="noindent">After milk coffee for breakfast, I took a collective van deeper into the Dad&#232;s Gorges looking for the end of the line. I was the last one out the van again. Ventured out onto the main street without any idea where to begin.</p>
<p class="noindent">Wandered into a shop where giant translucent quartz and spiralized ammonite fossils commandeered high dusty shelves inside. The shopkeeper offered me a seat and a welcoming tea.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ahmed had a gentle, shining face, his cheeks full of smile lines. He had been a miner for some years at Imider, the biggest silver mine on the continent. He had little formal education but a wealth of geological and parenting knowledge, having opened this shop when his wife left him with their three young children almost twenty years ago. He had managed with the help of family and friends.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I&#8217;m running away,&#8221; I admitted, bowing my head.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;What are you running from?&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Myself.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;If the mountain won&#8217;t come to you, then you must go to the mountain. The answers are all around you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Before I could respond, Ahmed called out to his sons, &#8220;Habib! Siddiq! Mustafa!&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Three handsome young men emerged from behind a curtain at the far end, each taller than the next. Habib and Siddiq both in their mid-twenties were followed by the youngest, a towering, six-foot-six Mustafa, who had to bow at the threshold to enter the room.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ahmed introduced us and asked each one the same question in Tamazight. The elder brothers gave long answers but Mustafa remained silent. Patient. When it came his turn, he bowed his head with a smile and immediately Ahmed appointed him to be my hiking guide for the day.</p>
<p class="noindent">As Mustafa approached to shake my hand, I saw his sweet duvet of vellus hair growing above the upper lip and out the sides of his nose. A slim eighteen-year-old with bulging mountainous muscles in the legs, he started out quick into the gorge and I struggled to keep up. He took his appointment seriously, silently at first.</p>
<p class="noindent">We passed through the thick forest valley of soft fruits, almond, date palm and orange. All the houses were attached to each other in the tiny village on the other side. We took the narrow red road past a collective granary where two men stacked jute bags of barley. Arrived at the family home for tea, olives, and warm khubz dipped in argan oil, Mustafa&#8217;s little brother, sisters, mother and grandmother for company. We ate together while listening to Michael Jackson&#8217;s <em>Thriller</em> on cassette.</p>
<p class="noindent">Stuffed ourselves with the good bread, then by early afternoon headed out into the sun and rough terrain where sheep and climbing goats showed better dexterity than I. We hiked for hours in the valley bed, the sun hitting our backs while, ahead of us, the gateway to the gorge opened its soaring walls three hundred feet high above the rugged rock pass. No souls in sight as the path narrowed to just one foot across. Sheer cliffs rose high on either side, millions of years compacted into red lime and sandstone.</p>
<p class="noindent">We took a break to smoke kif and drink water. Passed the sebsi between us in silence with private thoughts running so quick around our heads that we couldn&#8217;t speak. There was a palpable force between us heightened by the silence. Then, right beside me on the ground, a cracked open geode exposing its crystalline pink hollow. Excited, we began throwing rock against rock wall to see if any more precious minerals lay inside. A window opened between us and everything was allowed to mix together. We found more geodes and unusual black stones that Mustafa did not recognize. Filled our pockets as the sun lowered its head behind the High Atlas.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once back at the beginning, Mustafa and I lay out our treasures on the counter and Ahmed was clearly pleased. &#8220;These are for you,&#8221; we both said.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;You found treasure, <em>Mashallah!&#8221;</em> he exclaimed, looking closely at the stones. Picking up a black one, he examined it for some time, &#8220;But these ones are pieces of meteorite. You found rocks from heaven, sister. I can&#8217;t take them, they are valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">I refused. Ahmed left the room. He returned and set five crystals down on the countertop, each a bright coloured orb its own force. I picked one up, aragonite&#8212;a translucent orange bomb in mid-explosion. Vanadinite had blood red hexagon crystals jeweled into rock, red dragon quartz, pink candy calcite and mild desert rose. All treasure.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;These are for you,&#8221; said Ahmed. &#8220;Some are from the Sahara and others, from the Atlas. The guest is a gift from God.&#8221; And all the day was crystalline.</p>
<p class="noindent">Mustafa had disappeared by the time Ahmed brought out a bottle of fig liqueur, and we raised our glass. I asked him what question he had posed to his sons earlier in Tamazight.</p>
<p class="noindent">He laughed. &#8220;I knew they would all want to accompany a beautiful woman on a hike in the mountains, so I asked each of them to give some account of their laziness. Habib answered that he was so intuitive about the human being that he barely needed to lift a finger, then Siddiq said that he could know someone by sheer compulsion. But Mustafa simply smiled. He did the least to transmit to me his desire to spend time with you. He harvested without even ploughing.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;It means, you take care of your business and let Allah take care of Allah&#8217;s business. These two wings work together to make the bird fly.&#8221;</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-25">The Gatekeeper</p>
<p class="noindent">Next day there was a small caravan heading east to Sahara; it was led by a broad-shouldered man with silver hair at the temples and a thick, luxuriant beard. He had a hearty laugh as he approached and bowed. Something about him magnetic, commanding.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;As-salamu alaykum, je m&#8217;appelle Ali.&#8221;</em> His hand on his heart, he smiled and his brown eyes opened wide, peaceful and full of luster. &#8220;Come,&#8221; said Ali, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take you to the desert.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">We jolted up and down for hours in the jeep on rough, sun-cracked terrain. The road was arduous, perspiratory and dense. Ali barely spoke a word to his companion or the two French tourists and me in the back seat. I asked if he had been born in the desert.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I have been bringing people into <em>alsahra&#8217;</em> for many years. I used to be more active in my community, but now I live slowly. Carry messages from the town to the desert and back again. Spend time with my family, work on the farm. Dig wells. I&#8217;m good at locating water. <em>It&#8217;s never the value of water but thirst.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="noindent">We had left the mountains for flat, roadless, black hamada. The horizon soon became nothing. By late afternoon we had reached Kasbah le Touareg in Mer-zouga. A refurbished cube in the middle of horizontal earth, a tiny fortress against the massive Erg Chebbi sand dune behind it&#8212;first glimpse of Sahara&#8217;s edge. You&#8217;ve got to be brave to wear black in the desert.</p>
<p class="noindent">Our bags unloaded, I mentioned that I would walk around the village to find the kasbah that someone had recommended.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without warning, Ali&#8217;s temper took fire, &#8220;There are rooms in <small>THIS</small> hotel for everyone! It&#8217;s not expensive <small>AT ALL</small> for tourists!&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">He picked up my backpack and headed toward Le Touareg. I ran and took it from him. He seized my arm.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I did not bring you all this way for nothing. Not everyone is allowed into the desert! This is the city of knowledge. These are not enemy lands, sister,&#8221; as he released my arm. &#8220;Trust me. What you are seeking is right in front of you. There is nothing else nearby. This is a good place.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Eyvallah,&#8221;</em> said a voice from the other side of the story.</p>
<p class="noindent">Later, once the intensity of the day had subsided, I joined the French couple for a late afternoon walk. The temperature was plunging and the breeze whipped sand in our faces as we followed the trail of tire tracks down to the dunes. Ali and his companions joined in and persuaded us over to Dayet Srij, a glassy lake of rainwater. Often a dry bed, it was today a sprawling expanse. In the dream distance, the massive amber Erg Chebbi dune reflected in it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Miraculous slender-necked flamingos with pink bodies and feathers dipped in fire and ash appeared. We moved in closer to the one-leggeds, black and blood-red wings lifting a heavy body. But union easy. Levitation, one of the five Sufi powers. Original whirling dervishes of the natural world. We gave thanks to Ali, who was truly adept at finding water.</p>
<p class="noindent">Heading back now, he guided us into the empty village where a carpet seller awaited our arrival. We were unable to escape. Ali was visibly annoyed by our lack of purchasing power.</p>
<p class="noindent">Late that night, I sat on the upper terrace under the ephemeral stars. There were jumping camel spiders and low-flying, carnivorous, long-eared bats nesting in the crevices of the kasbah. I lit some kif to ease the tension and Ali approached with his friends. We shared the kif and Ali joked.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;The Sahara Desert drifts into a bar. What does the bartender say?&#8221; He paused. &#8220;Long time no sea!&#8221; Everybody laughed. Soon after came talk of riding camels in the dunes at sunrise next day&#8212;for a hefty price. I declined. Ali persisted. I disappeared.</p>
<p class="noindent">The alarm sounded at half past four in the morning and I jumped out of a sweltering sleep to greet the Absolute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Walked straight out the back door into dune. Climbed up silent, immobile at the top of flashing peaks of sand as the sun gave <em>As-salam</em>. Rambled up the crest of higher dunes even. Algerian border just up ahead forty clicks. Desert dust gave me a proper whipping. Standing, seated or resting diagonal on a dune, she caught me. Crystals and fossils jutting out of the smooth cinnamon banks.</p>
<p class="noindent">The sun rose and pushed me and my mild melanin out the way. Back in the room, I removed my underwear and a cup of Sahara fell to the ground from between my legs. The Absolute is always with you.</p>
<p class="noindent">When I descended for breakfast, I saw Ali there with his companions. Overwhelmed by his presence, I knew I had to leave. They told me that public transport no longer ran from Merzouga. Ali was the only driver available to take me to the next town&#8212;for a price. The gatekeeper had me with the strength of a rock.</p>
<p class="noindent">I left at noon for Erfoud and the French couple joined the ride. Ali drove us again in silence. Out the window, the decaying corpse of a dromedary came into view by the side of the stark road. I threw it a prayer. The prayer was returned.</p>
<p class="noindent">In Erfoud, we each paid our portion. Suddenly, Ali said that thirty dirham was missing. As we argued, a crowd of taxi drivers congregated around us. It was a campaign against financial corruption and unfair tourist privileges, a disparity cry, a self-accounting.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;C&#8217;est beaucoup d&#8217;argent pour un marocain mais pas pour un touriste.&#8221;</em> It&#8217;s a lot of money for a Moroccan but not for a tourist.</p>
<p class="noindent">We surrendered. An hour later I was sitting at the back of a bus headed to Errachidia&#8212;dusty, barefoot and bleeding in Western clothes. That night, I heard Sufis chanting a <em>zikr</em> outside the hotel window as I smoked Marlboro after Marlboro sitting on the edge of the windowsill alone in the room.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>La ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah</em>, someone knocked at the door, <em>ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah</em>, when I answered, <em>ilaha illallah</em>, there was no one there, <em>ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah</em>, I returned to the window, <em>ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah</em>, but the <em>zikr</em> had ceased.</p>
