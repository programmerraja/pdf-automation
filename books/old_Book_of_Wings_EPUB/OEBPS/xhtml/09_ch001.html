<p class="h3" id="sec-01">Paris in the Springtime</p>
<p class="noindent">Today I left my lover for a room with a view. He had trouble managing his time travel with me. It took only a few days for him to pack up and sail on&#8212;two wings, <em>un oiseau</em>. He was careful, came with intention but left no seed. We dive like birds, even into shit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Outside the window, pigeons picked at invisible morsels on rue St-Jacques. Invasion took flight. Overcast sky that morning in the Latin Quarter. I took unsettled steps down the steep, winding, velvet staircase at l&#8217;H&#244;tel de M&#233;dicis without ever looking back. How could I? My heart lay burst on the horizon, a red ocean hemorrhage; it was Paris in the springtime.</p>
<p class="noindent">Did he think I would remain under such conditions? On our final night I chose to sleep on the wooden floor of our dusty room, waiting for daylight, waiting for the descent into Hell. I listened for Guan or Hausa voices to come save me, prayers of redemption, otherworldly African women to chant around my tomb. All I got were the heated moans of a woman making love in a nearby room.</p>
<p class="noindent">My vulva pulsed. I touched myself when Shams went out that morning before the flood. I hadn&#8217;t finished by the time he returned and resented him for it. In his outstretched hands, a bouquet of roses the colour of cowardice&#8212;as if this would lift my spirits beyond our departures.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a blunt second, Shams had aged a decade. Barely twenty-nine with wrinkles on the forehead now pronounced, a furrowed brow of doubt, the face of a guilt complex. There was no concealing a human being in supplication for falling out of love. Who knows how the heart moves, until it stops moving toward you. I did not see it coming. What do you do when the object of your love disappears in plain sight? Love lifts and is itself, a veil, said a voice from the other side of the story. This is the difference between rose-coloured and a hit of direct sun.</p>
<p class="noindent">Shams left for a moment to use the bathroom in the hall and I finished myself off outside of him quick, deep, for the first time without him in over a year&#8212;my own unfamiliar finger between the legs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the end, I left the room because so little of him was still in it. The only part that mattered had disappeared. I left the roses behind because <em>l&#8217;odeur de la mort &#233;tait insupportable</em>. Walked out into the cloudy fifth arrondissement. An early April morning, 2002. There are three versions of this story: mine, his and the Truth.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-02">Sorrow and Ceremony</p>
<p class="noindent">I took a sea-green leather seat in a far corner of La Contrescarpe and ordered red. The tavern was empty except for a fashionable French couple dipping toast points into duck liver p&#226;t&#233;, quietly bored with each other. In the corner by the tall bookcases, a Black Christian monk in full white tunic and brown scapular robes sat with coffee, reading <em>Le Monde</em> like nothing. His cinnamon skin glowed in the orange afternoon sun, he was draped in layers, wood-rosaried at the hip, wrist, and shoulder. He suddenly burst out laughing with his whole body. All our heads gunned. He caught himself quick, returned to calm, assiduous prayer. A vow of silence, folded hands. Folded newspaper, smooth syrupy fingers, nails pink and lustrous. The shine of melanin. Our eyes met and he smiled wide. Solidarity says, &#8220;Smile, sister, this too shall pass.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">I bowed my head in his direction, put my hand to heart, but I am not comfortable. This calm is a public exterior.</p>
<p class="noindent">I am ill. I cannot hug this road alone, operate the device with any real accuracy. The tentacles aren&#8217;t connected to me. Aren&#8217;t my own.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Monsieur! Un autre verre, j&#8216;vous prie. Il me faut la t&#234;te chaude avant le coucher du soleil.&#8221;</em> Sir! Another glass, please. I need my head hot before the sun sets.</p>
<p class="noindent">When hiding in the shadows, smoke is a natural shield. I tried in vain to bring up the image of greying skin, cracked cheeks concave as they sucked on a cigarette, creases remaining long after inhalation, ashes embedded in skin. This did nothing to detract me. The old habit returned with ease and I took up smoking like an old lover.</p>
<p class="noindent">Near the end of our affair, Shams would not even let me into his mouth. Lips closed at the nearing, legs shut, eyes on some upward vanishing point. I smashed a left shin into the corner of the bed one afternoon. It crippled me for a moment he did not react to. The scar remains to this day. Bone-deep but only a tinted scratch on the surface at the time. Airborne oil. A heavy leak. Ours were not real actions anymore, they were transactions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The dry grape filled my head after only four sips. I sat calm in the corner, trying for a low profile. It had only been a few days since Shams had flown, though his body remained nearby. I could feel it.</p>
<p class="noindent">I walked out of the bar after four glasses, if only to retain my public dignity. Now I&#8217;m drunk on the wine of my own making. Ha! But to uncork devotion simply through the tempered wails of the newborn, celibate, wedded to prophets. O Ancestors, where are your ceremonies? Please, I need them now.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-03">Dream Fist</p>
<p class="noindent">That night in the dream I had a meeting with a man. He was waiting for me at the wrong place, standing in ruins under high Corinthian columns. Taking my hand, we entered the ancient city network. Was it Alexandria or Pergamum?</p>
<p class="noindent">Walking the stone capital at night, it began to rain. Unknown insects fell to the ground. Snow fell in with the insects. I ask my friend what the dream means. She tells me it is a wet dream.</p>
<p class="noindent">I arrived at the Great Library and it began to rain scarabs. I picked one up from the snowy ground and removed its carapace, licked its inner meat. Shams says that this dream is of things coming to an end.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I know better,&#8221; I say. &#8220;Even when you sense apocalypse, pluck some of it off the ground and feast.&#8221;</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-04">The Disappearance of the Disappearance</p>
<p class="noindent">I want freedom. Freedom from following. I advise you, my wrath is strong. It is rhythmic smoke from my nostrils, lightning from my hands, twice. It controls the degree of lust in the glance of a silver-haired French father holding his child on rue Soufflot. He blushes. Brushes my shoulder walking past, past the Panth&#233;on of the deads where the living pay silver to visit stone. Here, take my pelvis, you rock, a dying response to Love. These movements are not engineered, they are reactive.</p>
<p class="noindent">I am I, we shall not change me. A minor improvement in the document perhaps, an amendment to the law. My methods of escape include road, water, air and direct death; Shams&#8217; method required no movement at all. He just stood there. No one can touch me now. I pound at the heart of my own wound. This is a forward disowning of the body. I take off my clothes and reveal it.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Look for the Beloved,&#8221; said Shams, turning away from me.</p>
<p class="noindent">Now I will tell my people about the man who left me for a stick of bamboo. Ha! I left him for the mother of all Africa. But this was not a time for war. I had brought him to paradise and he left me there. Next time, I won&#8217;t bring anyone so close to the water, if they are still learning to swim and I, to drown. If you see me with arms flailing about, <small>DO NOT SAVE ME</small>. I am flying away.</p>
