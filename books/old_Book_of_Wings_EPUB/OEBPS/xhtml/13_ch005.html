<p class="h3" id="sec-42">The Bardo of the Moment of Death</p>
<p class="noindent">That night in the dream, Shams is lying in my arms in bed. I keep asking if this is real. He looks up at me but is not responsive. I wake myself up out of fear.</p>
<p class="noindent">I am pungent this morning. Putrid. Last night&#8217;s burnt onions, cumin, hard-boiled eggs and french fries are already releasing their poisons. My stomach is a sulfuric mess&#8212;what rot. Like flies, he is attracted to my scent.</p>
<p class="noindent">I rarely bathe now. It causes countless social problems. They let me shower at the men&#8217;s public bath because women only have the hammam. This devours me both as woman and woman kept. I have pimples everywhere but he loves me and I am saved&#8212;no matter for how long.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;J&#8217;en ai vraiment mare de cette vie de chien&#8212;qu&#8217;est ce que tu en dis? En g&#233;n&#233;ral je me sens comme un &#234;tre affreux, ravag&#233;, corps et esprit. J&#8217;entends, j&#8217;entends la Totale!&#8221;</em> wails Matthieu. I&#8217;m really sick of this dog life&#8212;what do you say? These days I feel like an awful, ravaged person. Body and mind. I hear, I hear the Absolute. &#8220;And I still can&#8217;t understand how a woman like you could care about me, stay with me, and desire me even&#8212;deep down maybe I&#8217;m not all bad, plus I write well. I would offer you ten more crazy years of youth before we made any babies.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I can no longer be sexual with you,&#8221; I blurt out in imperfect French.</p>
<p class="noindent">Matthieu shrugs his shoulders and with a childlike look says, &#8220;That&#8217;s okay, I have no sex drive, anyway. I don&#8217;t care. I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Look!&#8221; I shout, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had it up to here lying in wait like a lunatic in the Middle Atlas smoking your Marquises. I&#8217;m with you but I&#8217;m not with you! In my heart I&#8217;m with someone else, I&#8217;m still with Shams!&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Matthieu pauses for some time before countering. In a gentle manner, he says, &#8220;I have the impression that our relationship is based on a kind of misunderstanding, or in fact on several misunderstandings. But that doesn&#8217;t take away my love for you&#8212;it remains intact.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">The ghosts liberate themselves from the walls, it is soon time to leave. We calm down by smoking kif, drinking opium. He retires. I can do nothing against this desperation. Intoxicate me full time, I beg of you! It is greater than I. This broken heart is a violent release of energy that detonates in the chest and causes a surge unknown to the vast majority. I imprison myself. Disfigure myself. Consume myself. There is nothing left to eat. I don&#8217;t eat. I am static, well-drugged and well-sentenced to a permanent condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">Meanwhile, Matthieu lets out a bloodcurdling scream from the next room and I run. He is facing the far window, gesticulating wild. His speech frenetic. Body jerks to one side. Suddenly, he turns around and talks at an invisible person beside me, then another. He is hallucinating people all around him in the room. Morbid visions. Abrupt, he lets out another thundering cry, strikes the air fighting an unknown assailant. Lunges at me but loses his balance and crashes to the floor, trembling. His eyes are open but he does not see. Does not hear. A manic episode. We stop breathing.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-43">The Clear Lights Seen Immediately After Death</p>
<p class="noindent">In a state of terror. His body has seized up. I freeze inside myself. Crippled while also wanting to run. But I can only kneel before him, and take his foot in my hand. Massage the feet, the fingertips like prayer beads. <em>La ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah</em>. He does not react. And everywhere prayer. The <em>azan</em> gives the call and all the day is quartz. <em>La ilaha illallah, La ilaha illallah</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Je sais que tu n&#8217;as jamais rencontr&#233; quelqu&#8217;un comme moi. Admet le. Admet le,&#8221;</em> he mumbles half-consciously as I put him to bed. I know you&#8217;ve never met anyone like me. Admit it. Admit it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Matthieu eventually falls asleep. I place him on the mattress, cover him with a blanket and put a wine bottle of water beside the bed. <em>Al Fatiha</em>. Heal those who need it. Become more deeply self by removing self. A power progresses through these impulses.</p>
<p class="noindent">Was his seizure caused by an excess of opium? Had he lied about taking his medication? Was this the clear light?</p>
<p class="noindent">Next evening when Matthieu finally wakes, he has no memory of the psychotic break. We shower together at the men&#8217;s public bath. Our tears nothing under the cold water of these final Moroccan ablutions. The end has a scent. It breathes through us. We lose ourselves in impossible thoughts, oncoming shrouds of rain, necessary testing grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;It&#8217;s like I imagined something happened, dreamt it. I&#8217;m not sure, Maya. Did I hurt you? Did I harm you in any way?&#8221; he asks, stroking my neck under the shower.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;No&#8212;but I was ready to run.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;I&#8217;m never violent,&#8221; he says confident, taking me in his arms under the spray. &#8220;I see the light now, I&#8217;ll be fine, Maya. Kiss me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">It took a season in hell to begin a move away from Shams and time with those offering more than I could ever offer in return. These days we move very little, but our travels are great.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-44">The Bardo of the Experiencing of Reality (1)</p>
<p class="noindent">I flee Matthieu early one August morning though I don&#8217;t know that I did it the right way. I became the coward, or perhaps the renunciant.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is an introduction to my decline. I am cursed now, alone in Ville Nouvelle. The city volume pushes hard against heavy hearing, heavy thought. Hold the robes! Perhaps there is a need for ceremony in all this. Humility. Grace. Ritual. I take all these things and separate myself while equally absorbed by the crowd. An extroverted introvert attempting the Great Memory.</p>
<p class="noindent">One of the songs that the West African ancestors brought through the wretched Middle Passage to enslavement in the Caribbean was <em>La Alla LaLa</em>. A clear prayer all the way to beloved Wadadli/Antigua, up to beloved Tiohti&#224;:ke/ Montr&#233;al and now back to the beloved Source. The Great Memory. Astonishment at the familiar. The book and the Mysteries. Ask Shams, he initiated me, though neither of us knew it. <em>La ilaha illallah</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The men here would not hurt me, though their crotches move involuntarily at my passing. I know they are my brothers, but I have not walked by myself in some time. I buy a brass teapot from a shopkeeper named Husayn whose hand grazes my breast twice, mid-sentence. He has a bright round face and a black turban from which dark reddish hair peeks out. He peers at me over his half-moon glasses.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Are you married?&#8221; he inquires, palming his generous beard.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Are you?&#8221; I retort.</p>
<p class="noindent">We both laugh uncomfortably, neither of us answering. He vanishes into a back room and emerges with a tiny silver hamsa. The Hand of Fatima. Mark of protection. Eye of conscience.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;The five fingers on this Hand of Fatima represent the People of the Cloak, <em>Ahl al-Bayt:</em> Hazreti Muhammad <em>&#8216;alayhi s-sal&#257;m</em>, Imam Ali, Hassan, Husayn and Fatima, the shining one. <em>Inshallah</em> you had good encounters with us here in the land of God.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">With these words he places the hand in my hand. It is intricate silver with a glass blue eye staring up central like a full moon that follows you at night in a recurring dream. I disappear inside all those who had come before.</p>
<p class="noindent">The paradox inherent in travel, the response system, the gall, the privilege, the gifts, the assaults and accounting. Prayer and disrespect side by side. My presence here is not real, but imagined, created with cash and abandon and a desire for all that has been lost.</p>
<p class="noindent">I&#8217;m weak and nearing the end now. Carrying this weight since the disappearance of Shams. I want to be logical but it is difficult. All things repressed are surfacing. Moment of death, the death of love. I go on living despite myself. I do not want to make connections. My heart is bursting. I may die of fright at the awareness of my own condition. If I ever saw Shams again, all my features would fall. Fall into a slow <em>zikr</em>, the <em>zikr</em> of no end.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-45">The Bardo of the Experiencing of Reality (2)</p>
<p class="noindent">They&#8217;ve split my body all over the pavement. They are kicking my dust all over the place. The Seeing quickly abandon me. Even Shams left me for a hollow reed and a country. I hope they are both good lovers for him.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no remedy for this pain. It is not getting easier to accept. A loss grips the throat, crushes the inside of the head, pounds at the chest. A dense pain in the constant belly, loins up. I am on my knees, bloodied. Crawling the medina blind, touching walls to find my place, mouth open to receive racism and flies with more courage than I. Words are cold coming out of my mouth. I have lost the way to my mouth.</p>
<p class="noindent">What I need is an exorcism, I am beyond simple prayer now. Presently mad. Non-functional, antisocial, in hibernation. Plagued with memories of Shams and abandonment. In need of cigarettes and water but too frightened of the species to go out and get some. What is this abyss? Even the wind will not take it. From whom did I inherit this? What African ancestry wastes so much on tears?</p>
<p class="noindent">Doors pounding in this hotel are too loud. I search for errors in the tiling. I hit my knee on the table reaching for an itch. There is no sleep, only cockroaches. Last night one ends up on its back, immobile. I give it my pencil to grip and send it back to the great Outdoors. Madness. A reminder. The call to prayer is awful in this town. High pitched and uninviting like Sirens in the city. May the sound of Sirens be far away from you. They can throw curses like I can throw skin. Androgynous even, you&#8217;ll never see us coming.</p>
<p class="noindent">Is this how to be perfectly supple and pliable in the hands of Truth? Not stiff like a corpse, they tell me. I remember now. There is no way to forget.</p>
<p class="noindent">This peeling of paper-thin skin is a violent acceptance of the past, adherence to the moment. There&#8217;s nothing left to lose, nowhere left to turn, and so I turn myself in/to You. From a knot in the plexus, a lump of imagination, a lesson in vulnerability. This pain, an energy pattern. The transit of Saturn. The whole work of the whole heart. The whole story witnessed from just beyond the stage.</p>
<p class="noindent">I held onto Shams tight. To let go was to die. But Shams let go instead, and I died. Posthumously, I&#8217;ll tell all.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-46">The After-Death World</p>
<p class="noindent">In the dream, we are at the edge of a large field of rolling hills near the sea. The landscape is bathed in a muted silver. There is a warm, pleasing wind across the open expanse. An eerie twilight before the rise when moon still cuts a pearl on the water. A few people are in conversation or walking around aimlessly in the distance.</p>
<p class="noindent">Sitting beside me is the man who will become my <em>sem-azenbashi</em>. He is the observer, the one who watches. I would later learn to fast and cross the harbour by boat every week to study with him. When you long for something lost, when you don&#8217;t know where to turn, whirling is logical.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the dream, the observer speaks without speaking. His lips do not move but the message is clear. &#8220;Die before you die,&#8221; says a voice that is not his.</p>
<p class="noindent">The people around us were being transformed. Some had died of old age or in their sleep, some from accidents, war injuries or disease. One man was completely deformed. His jaw was wide open, bleeding, there was no skin, and his face was covered in red pustules. Some bodies were solid, others transparent. Some bodies were missing limbs, one was headless.</p>
<p class="noindent">We were in the land of the dead where the ones who do not yet realize they have died must die again. Once acceptance of death occurs, the transparencies and deformities are replaced with solidity. The person is whole again, organic, tranquil, happy and briefly unlimited.</p>
<p class="noindent">Pray the Truth comes quickly for us all. Though I have partial sight, it will take millennia for this eclipse to fully pass.</p>
<p class="h3" id="sec-47">The Process of Rebirth</p>
<p class="noindent">Today, despair takes a step back with the arrival of Matthieu in Fes to wish me goodbye. He had sobered up, turned ascetic the last five days without me. His florid cheeks and freshly shaven head pleased me. His presence kept the sorrow at bay. My thermal south briefly warmed in the hands of this poet. Being in love takes on new meaning. Without an object, what does one do with the feeling? Perhaps in the middle of <em>that</em> ocean, with no land in sight, the only choice is surrender, the giving away.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Il y a des moments o&#249; &#231;a fait peur et tu sais comme mon &#233;quilibre mental est fragile.&#8221;</em> There are times when it&#8217;s scary and you know how my mental state is fragile, says Matthieu.</p>
<p class="noindent">I arrived in parts but managed to put myself together with water, khubz, modest clothing, resin, bitter wine, carnal endeavours and Matthieu, the gift from God.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;And your vow of chastity?&#8221; I ask.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Chasti-what?&#8221; he replies, stroking my sex.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>&#8220;Nous vivons beaucoup de choses en peu de temps,&#8221;</em> he whispers in my ear. We are living many things in a short time. &#8220;Kiss me Maya, it&#8217;s my birthday.&#8221; He is twenty-one.</p>
<p class="noindent">Shams is nothing but poetry now. We were briefly immortal, then both guilty. I must take responsibility for myself.</p>
<p class="noindent">I hear through the mouths of others that Shams is well. Not long after we had split in Paris, news arrived that he had been spotted in Istanbul and had possibly taken a wife. Take refuge, leave refuge. I failed to keep the company of my beloved. But I will never fail Love. One Truth is hidden inside all the events of the world. And now, there is no separation from the company of Secrets. It was the company sought all along.</p>
<p class="noindent">I came to the door of Love but you turned me away. So this one became a dervish in the axis of the heart. Now there is a dervish at the door, to whom no one can refuse entry.</p>
